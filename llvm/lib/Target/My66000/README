This is a very experimental backend for the My66000 architecture designed by Mitch Alsup.
Some things work for simple programs. Lots of things do not work yet, see the ToDo list below.

Use the normal LLVM build process with the added cmake flag
  -DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="My66000"


Usage Restrictions
==================
Must use --frame-pointer=none.

Command Line Options
====================
--enable-predication        bool default=false
--enable-carry-generation   bool default=false
--early-carry-coalesce      bool default=false
--enable-remove-range-check bool default=false


********
* ToDo *
********

* Enable removal of jump table range check.

* Enable multiword add using carry.

* Implement predication for && and ||.

* Implement 32-bit floating point.

* Implement frame pointer.

* Fix tail calls so they work.

* Implement bundled predicated instruction sequences.

* Optimize carry sequences.

* Implement bundled carry sequences.

* Implement vec/loop sequences.

* Remove range check for jump tables.

* Compute correct instruction sizes for variable length instructions.

* Implement code models:
  small - all code fits in 28 bits
  large - all external jumps must be 64 bits.

* Implement ELF output.  This could be a lot of work.

* Enable clang support.

* Enable lld support.  (Need ELF machine code assignment.)
